# Numbo

Title: Numbo

Creator: Isaac Sanchez

Code/devices: Uses the Launchpad Mini device, as well as Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Description: Numbo; This piece delves into the indifference of computer programs. The character in this website, Numbo, requests only large numbers through API calls, not caring whether these statistics come from high amounts of poverty or high amounts of healtcare coverage.

Instructions: First, connect a Launchpad Mini to the computer and set it to "User" through its keypads. Then, after accessing the website, select one of the four starting options to provide Numbo Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) state codes (found at https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt) to use to obtain data from api.census.gov APIs through API calls. Different categories can also be selected for the API call before confirming the FIPS code (either poverty or healthcare related). Once the FIPS code is entered, the timeline can be started. As Numbo obtains data from the selected state in chronological order, it will react through the Launchpad Mini, expressing a mix of emotions depending on whether the numbers/ratios are sufficiently large enough for it.

Goal of the project: Get a laugh from the user, while also giving them an idea of poverty/healthcare insurance levels for different U.S. states.
